All the datasets are derived from a growing collection, AndroZoo ([https://androzoo.uni.lu/](https://androzoo.uni.lu/)), 
which currently contains over nine million different APKs, each of which has been (or will soon be) 
analysed by several different AntiVirus products in VirusTotal ([https://www.virustotal.com/](https://www.virustotal.com/)) 
to know which applications are detected as malware. The datasets used in our experiments can be obtained from AndroZoo 
through the given sha256 ([https://androzoo.uni.lu/api_doc](https://androzoo.uni.lu/api_doc)).
